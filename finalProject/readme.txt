# Plum Station Website
This website is still under construction. It will contain three games and be flexible across devices when done.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Games
This website hosts three games in total. Brief overviews of each are shown below:

### Twin Snakes -- UNDER EARLY DEVELOPMENT
A local versus take on the classic Snake game. Duke it out between two players, controlling each snake with WASD
and arrow key schemes respectively. Winning conditions go to the last who survives.

### The Witful -- NOT STARTED
A short level-based puzzle game featuring guiding a pointer through a grid. Obstacles will pose various challenges 
to the player.

### Falling Upward -- NOT STARTED
A prototype of a puzzle-platformer game. The game controls with 4-directional movement, but the player can only
stop once they reach another valid surface.
